What the project does:
This app compares the Series A Brazilian championship TV broadcast revenue to football clubs, according to LIBRA’s and LFF’s proposals.
why it is useful:
it clarifies the differences between the proposals, comparing both The gross broadcast revenue, as well as the revenue relative to each one of the three buckets, namely: egalitarian, performance and audience.
how users can make use of it.
users just have to choose two different clubs, the final position for each one of them in the competition, and the amount of the contract to be distributed. the outcome of the app is a chart comparing the gross broadcast revenue, another chart comparing the revenue per bucket, and a financial summary at the end.
